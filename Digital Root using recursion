/*You are given a number n. You need to find the digital root of n. DigitalRoot of a number is the recursive sum of its digits until we get a single digit number.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 1
Output:  1
Explanation: Digital root of 1 is 1
Example 2:

Input:
n = 99999
Output: 9
Explanation: Sum of digits of 99999 is 45
which is not a single digit number, hence
sum of digit of 45 is 9 which is a single
digit number*/
